- January: [Vanilla Panna Cotta](../recipe/jan/vanilla-panna-cotta.md)

Step 1
Break off or trim the woody ends from the asparagus and discard. Set the spears aside.

Step 2
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the pine nuts, cranberries, and salt. Cook and stir until the pine nuts start to look translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the asparagus spears and cook, adding a little more olive oil if needed, until stalks are bright green and tender, about 5 to 8 minutes. Serve on a platter with the cranberries and nuts spooned over the top of the asparagus.'
